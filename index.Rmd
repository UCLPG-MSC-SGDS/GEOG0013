# Welcome to Introduction to Statistics {.unnumbered}

Welcome to **GIF1's** **Introduction to Statistics**. So far you have been introduced to the core tenets and principles of geography taught through the different themes touching on physical sciences (e.g., coastal and rivers) and social sciences (e.g., ethnographic methods and urbanism). This session focuses on the themes of **statistics** (i.e., data analysis). Here, we will provide you with an introduction to the basic statistical methods for exploring & representing secondary data from Barcelona, using a programming software tool known as **R/RStudio**, as well as using **R/RStudio** to introduce you to the basics of probability distributions and how they can be use for making predictions.

**Getting started with the learning process (Length: 13:50 minutes)**

<div class="note">
**IMPORTANT NOTES**: The locations for groups **A**, **B**, **D**, **E**, and **G** are public clusters with PC workstations. Nevertheless, I highly recommend you bring your own laptop to the computer practicals for ease. The locations for groups **C** and **F** are seminar rooms. You **MUST** bring your own laptop as this is **NOT** a public cluster with PC workstations.

## Self-guided tutorials {-}

You have been given early access to the content. Prior to the workshops which will be supported by the teaching assistants (PGTAs), you are welcome to go through the self-guided tutorials presented on this website at your own pace. The teaching materials have been designed to be accessible to anyone who has never used RStudio in their life. It is also accessible to anyone who has never done statistics before as well. With that being said, we are introducing you to the absolute basics of R-programming and statistics. Hence, these tutorials are prescriptive with instructions which are further supported by guided videos.

## Questions & Discusson Forum on Moodle {-}

On Moodle, you can use the **Forum: Questions and Discussion** platform to post general questions about the content on this webpage, or for posting problems on technical issues you have encountered during your self-guided study. I, or one of the PGTAs will respond accordingly with solutions. Students are welcome to engage and support each other in-person and/or through this forum during this self-study time, and so kindly use the forum on Moodle - thank you! Please **do not send direct emails to Helen, Geography Office or me for resolving technical problems** - we will only respond to emails on critical matters (e.g., personal problems, illness, etc.,).
